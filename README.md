# 🖥️ AlgoSimOS

**AlgoSimOS** is a web-based simulation project designed to demonstrate key Operating System algorithms using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project covers essential concepts like page replacement, process scheduling, and disk scheduling by implementing algorithms such as LRU (Least Recently Used), Producer-Consumer, SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next), and SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First).

## 🚀 Features

- **LRU (Least Recently Used) Algorithm** 📝
  - Simulates page replacement strategies to optimize memory management.
  
- **Producer-Consumer Problem** 🔄
  - Demonstrates inter-process communication and synchronization using semaphores.

- **SRTN (Shortest Remaining Time Next) Scheduling** 🕒
  - Implements CPU scheduling to minimize waiting time and improve process efficiency.

- **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First) Disk Scheduling** 📀
  - Simulates disk scheduling to reduce the seek time and improve I/O efficiency.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The primary language for implementing the logic of algorithms.
- **HTML**: Structure of the web interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the web interface.
